# Pacman

A not-so-accurate recreation of Pacman in TypeScript, interface written in React.

This project is far from finished, but has reached a basic, playable MVP state. As my time is limited I've elected to stop here, for now.

## Features
- Interface in React
- Basic gameplay
- ~~Mobile Touch Controls~~
- ~~Score API~~
